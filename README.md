A website that showcases my work for the Odin Project. It is hosted on Github pages [here](https://c-likethis123.github.io/odin_project_showcase/)

## Credits

I used a HTML5 template called Spectral, taken from [HTML5Up](http://html5up.net). In addition, I used icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/license).
